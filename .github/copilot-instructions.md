- Emphasize proper tool handling and storage
- Document workspace setup and ventilation requirements

### 2. Process Documentation
- Write clear step-by-step procedures
- Include material specifications and sourcing
- Document common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Provide troubleshooting guides for each process
- Reference relevant industry standards where applicable

### 3. Skills Progression
- Start with basic hand tool operations
- Progress to power tools with proper safety
- Introduce digital fabrication methods
- Connect skills to real-world applications
- Build towards product manufacturing capabilities
