# Introduction to Machining Operations

Cutting mode is composed of three main styles ; turning, milling, and drilling. By choosing an appropriate cutting tool according to the cutting mode, hard metals can be machined efficiently.

# Turning

External holder and internal boring bar produce round shaped workpieces. Machining processes that use holders or boring bars is called turning, and its main characteristic is that workpieces rotate.

The machine used for turning is called a lathe.

# Milling

Milling tools can be divided into two types ; one is face milling which machines the workpiece surface and the other is endmilling which performs slotting shoulder milling etc.. Machining modes that use facemills and endmills are called milling operations, and its main characteristic is that the tools rotate. The machine used for milling is called a milling machine.

# Drilling

Uses a tool that produces circular holes in workpieces and is called a drill. Indexable insert type drills and brazed drills produce relatively large holes and solid drills produce smaller holes. The main characteristic of drilling is that it can be used for both milling and turning machines.
