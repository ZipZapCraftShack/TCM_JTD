# Introduction to Work-piece Materials

Cutting mode is composed of three main styles; turning, milling, and drilling. By choosing an appropriate cutting tool according to the cutting mode, hard metals can be machined efficiently.

# Workpiece Material Groups

The metal cutting industry produces an extremely wide variety of components machined from many different materials. Each material has its own unique characteristics that are influenced by alloying elements, heat treatment and hardness, etc. These, in turn, influence the choice of cutting tool geometry, grade and cutting data. To make this choice easier, workpiece materials are divided into six major groups, in accordance with ISO standards, and each group has unique properties regarding machinability:

{: .material-iso-p }
> Steel is the largest material group, ranging from unalloyed to high-alloyed material and including steel castings and ferritic and martensitic stainless steels. Machinability is usually good, but differs a lot depending on material hardness, carbon content, etc.

{: .material-iso-m }
>Stainless steels are materials alloyed with a minimum of 12% chromium. Other alloys may include nickel and molybdenum. Different conditions, such as ferritic, martensitic, austenitic and austenitic-ferritic (duplex), create a large range of materials. A commonality among all these materials is that the cutting edges are exposed to a great deal of heat, notch wear and built-up edge.

{: .material-iso-k }
>Cast iron, unlike steel, is a short-chipping type of material. Gray cast irons (GCI) and malleable cast irons (MCI) are quite easy to machine, while nodular cast irons (NCI), compact cast irons (CGI) and austempered cast irons (ADI) are more difficult. All cast irons contain SiC, which is very abrasive to the cutting edge.

{: .material-iso-n }
> Non-ferrous metals are softer metals, such as aluminum, copper, brass, etc. Aluminum with a Si-content of 13% is very abrasive. Generally, high cutting speeds and long tool life can be expected for inserts with sharp edges.

{: .material-iso-s }
>Heat resistant super alloys include a great number of high-alloyed iron-, nickel-, cobalt- and titanium-based materials. They are sticky, create built-up edge, harden during working (work hardening), and generate heat. They are very similar to the ISO M materials but are much more difficult to cut, and reduce the tool life of the insert edges.

{: .material-iso-h }
>This group includes steels with a hardness between 45–65 HRC, and also chilled cast iron around 400–600 HB. The hardness makes them difficult to machine. The materials generate heat during cutting and are very abrasive for the cutting edge.

{: .material-iso-other }
>Thermoplastics, thermosets, GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer/Plastic), CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic), carbon fiber composites, aramid fiber reinforced plastic, hard rubber, graphite (technical). Various industries are now using composites to a greater extent, especially in the aerospace industry.

# Milling

Milling tools can be divided into two types ; one is face milling which machines the workpiece surface and the other is endmilling which performs slotting shoulder milling etc.. Machining modes that use facemills and endmills are called milling operations, and its main characteristic is that the tools rotate. The machine used for milling is called a milling machine.

# Drilling

Uses a tool that produces circular holes in workpieces and is called a drill. Indexable insert type drills and brazed drills produce relatively large holes and solid drills produce smaller holes. The main characteristic of drilling is that it can be used for both milling and turning machines.
