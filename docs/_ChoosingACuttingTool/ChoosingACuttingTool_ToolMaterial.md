## High Speed Steel (HSS)

Made from a blend of chromium, tungsten, and molybdenum, HSS offers greater hardness, toughness, and durability compared to conventional carbon steel. It is well-suited for both ferrous and nonferrous metals, withstanding higher temperatures and wear during milling operations.

### Advantages

- **Economical:** Cost-effective compared to advanced materials.
- **Tough and Forgiving:** Ideal for operators with less experience.
- **Shock Absorbing:** Suitable for less rigid setups.
- **Versatile:** Works with various materials.

## Solid Carbide (Carbide)

This material is a composite of carbon and tungsten, forming a highly resistant compound. Carbide endmills are preferred for their ability to maintain performance under demanding conditions, such as machining hard materials and achieving high-quality surface finishes. They are particularly effective in newer milling machines that operate at high speeds.

### Advantages

- **Hardness and Durability:** Provides the longest tool life.
- **Longest Tool Life:** Outlasts Cobalt & HSS by 10-20 times reducing cost over the long run.
- **Efficiency:** Allows higher feed rates and RPM, can run 3 to 5 times faster feed rates and Higher RPM than Cobalt tooling.


## Our Recommendation For Beginners

- **Starting Tools:** We recommend starting with HSS tooling when you're new to CNC or manual milling. This is because HSS is more forgiving of errors, which are common as you learn to home/zero your machine, set up work-piece holding, and perform basic operations.
- **Progression:** Once you're comfortable with basic machining tasks and less likely to make costly mistakes, transitioning to carbide tools can significantly enhance your efficiency, skipping other tool materials all together.

## Powdered Metal (HSS-PM)

HSS Powdered Metal Endmills are made from powdered metals that are pressed and sintered to form the tool. They generally consist of HSS with additional elements such as cobalt or vanadium to enhance performance. They are particularly valuable for applications involving variable cutting loads and for machining tool steels and hardened steels.

### Advantages

    - **Hardened Steels:** PM endmills are particularly effective for machining tool steels and other hardened steels. Their toughness and wear resistance make them suitable for cutting materials with high hardness levels without excessive wear or chipping.
    - **Stainless Steels:** Known for their work-hardening properties and abrasive nature, stainless steels are well-suited for PM endmills. The fine grain structure of PM endmills allows for a sharp cutting edge that can maintain its integrity under the high temperatures generated when machining stainless steel.
    - **Titanium Alloys:** These materials are challenging to machine due to their strength and tendency to adhere to the cutting tool. PM endmills, particularly those with specific coatings, can effectively handle titanium by reducing wear and preventing material buildup on the cutting edge.
    - **Nickel-based Alloys:** Alloys such as Inconel and Waspaloy are used in high-temperature applications and are notoriously tough to machine. PM endmills, with their superior red hardness and durability, are capable of handling these materials, especially when high precision and finish quality are required.
    - **High-Temperature Alloys:** Other high-temperature alloys, including those used in aerospace applications, require tools that can withstand the extreme conditions without losing hardness. PM endmills are designed to excel in these environments, making them a preferred choice for aerospace component machining.
    - **Cast Irons:** While cast irons can often be machined using less advanced tools, PM endmills provide a higher level of performance, particularly with abrasive or high-silicon cast irons, due to their wear resistance and ability to maintain a sharp cutting edge.

## Solid Carbide (Carbide)

This material is a composite of carbon and tungsten, forming a highly resistant compound. Carbide endmills are preferred for their ability to maintain performance under demanding conditions, such as machining hard materials and achieving high-quality surface finishes. They are particularly effective in newer milling machines that operate at high speeds.

### Advantages

- **Hardness:** Offers the sharpest edges and maintains them under high temperatures.
- **Longest Tool Life:** Provides significantly longer life, reducing the need for frequent replacement.
- **Efficiency:** Capable of operating at higher speeds and feeds, enhancing productivity.
- **High Precision:** Capable of producing fine finishes and precise cuts, especially in tough materials.

### Disadvantages

- **Cost:** High initial investment, offset by longer lifespan with proper use.
- **Brittleness:** Carbide is unsuitable for "flexible" applications and should not be used in hand drills where tool flexing is likely.
- **Thermal Sensitivity:** Requires careful handling of cooling methods. Susceptible to thermal shock, most provide continuous OR no cooling, do not use a spray bottle
- Needs specialized equipment like a diamond grinder for resharpening.

### Grades/Types/Compositions

- Tantalum Carbide (TaC)
    - Added to increase resistance to cutting edge deformation at higher temperatures during heavy cuts

### Use Cases

- **High Precision Manufacturing:** Essential for achieving fine finishes in hard materials.
- **Work-piece Materials**
    - **Hardened Steels:** Carbide endmills excel at machining steels with high hardness levels (above 45 HRC), including tool steels and die steels. Their hardness allows them to maintain a sharp edge and resist wear during the machining of these tough materials.
    - **Stainless Steels:** The toughness and thermal resistance of carbide make it ideal for cutting austenitic, martensitic, and duplex varieties of stainless steel, which are commonly used in the medical and aerospace industries.
    - **Titanium Alloys:** These alloys, such as Titanium 6Al-4V, are notoriously difficult to machine due to their strength and low thermal conductivity. Carbide endmills can operate at high speeds necessary to prevent material build-up on the cutting edge, thereby avoiding premature tool failure.
    - **Nickel-based Alloys:** Materials like Inconel and Monel are used in aerospace and marine applications due to their corrosion resistance and strength at high temperatures. Carbide endmills are one of the few tools hard enough to effectively cut these materials efficiently.
    - **Composite Materials:** Carbide is often used to machine carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) and metal matrix composites (MMC). Its hardness and wear resistance are critical for achieving clean cuts and preventing material fraying or delamination.
    - **Precious Metals:** For industries working with precious metals like platinum, gold, and silver, where precision and finish quality are paramount, carbide endmills provide the necessary accuracy and surface finish.
    - **Aluminum Alloys:** Although softer, high-silicon aluminum alloys and other abrasive aluminum types can be effectively machined using carbide tools, particularly when a fine finish is required or when working at very high speeds.
    - **Hard Plastics and Acrylics:** For hard plastics and engineering polymers such as polycarbonate, PEEK, and acrylic, carbide endmills ensure smooth finishes and sharp, clean cuts without the material melting or deforming.

### Notes

- Must use high quality tool holders due to Carbide's brittleness and the higher cutting speeds
